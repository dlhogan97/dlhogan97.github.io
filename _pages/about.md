About Me
======
Hi, I'm Danny Hogan. I'm a graduate student at the University of Washington working in the [Mountain Hydrology Research Group](https://depts.washington.edu/mtnhydr/) studying the influences mountain meteorology has on mountain snowpacks and, in turn, on water resources within the Upper Colorado River Basin. I hail from the Bay Area, did my undergraduate degree in envrionmental engineering at Princeton University, rowed competitively in college, worked for 2-years after graduating, and moved up to Washington. I'm now fortunate enough to get to explore the amazing landscapes, weather, and ecosystems we have up here in the PNW with my wife and dog!

<!-- Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.  -->
