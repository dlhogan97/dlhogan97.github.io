Cool weather returned this week as the PNW sat between a closed low to our south and a passing shortwave that skirted a few of the mountains around the regions. Snow depths are small around Pass level. We got a decent dousing last weekend along with the first NWAC observations of the winter. This week, we have a ridge building into Friday, November 17, with cooler weather sticking around until clouds start to roll in on Saturday. Then, a quickly developing low-pressure system will hit northern Vancouver Island later Saturday into early Sunday. This will bump out the transient ridge, and usher in some strong winds down the straight, precipitation across the region, and snow for some mountains. Freezing levels are just above pass level (around 4000 feet), but should drop to pass level in the post-frontal environment with cold air coming in. The HRRR and NAM are showing an earlier setup with potentially higher totals, so we'll see how that trends. Generally, this system has a bit more precipitation oomph from the GFS, especially further south. This post will be updated with totals to see who got what!
