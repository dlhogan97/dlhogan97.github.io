excerpt: 'In this work, we found spring precipitation plays a vital role in explaining the descrepancy between precipitation, snowpack, and streamflow in the Upper Colorado River Basin during the ongoing Millennium Drought (2000-present), especially in lower elevations where potential evapotranspiration is higher during spring.'
